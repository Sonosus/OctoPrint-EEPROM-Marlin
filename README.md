## Setup

Install via the bundled [plugin manager](https://docs.octoprint.org/en/master/bundledplugins/pluginmanager.html) or manually using this URL:

    https://github.com/cp2004/OctoPrint-EEPROM-Marlin/releases/latest/download/release.zip

## Firmware requirements

This plugin requires that you have **both** these items in Marlin's `Configuration.h` file:

- `#define EEPROM_CHITCHAT`
- `//#define DISABLE_M503`

In other words, `EEPROM_CHITCHAT` and the M503 command must be enabled - comment out disabling it.

## New in Marlin EEPROM Editor V3.0.0

A complete re-write of this plugin, now V3!

Featuring:

- Python processing & storage, eliminating performance issues in the UI.
- Storage of data on the OctoPrint server, so it can be viewed while the printer is disconnected or printing.
- Brand new UI, written from the ground up.
- All-new backup feature, allowing naming and storing of backups, so you can quickly swap between profiles and more.
